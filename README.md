# WildBoarIPM
Code associated with formulating, implementing, and visualizing an analysis of wild boar population dynamics using an integrated population model (IPM).

## File description

 * `WildBoarIPM.R` <br/>
 Code for formulating, implementing, and running the model in NIMBLE.
 
 <br/>
 
 * `WildBoarIPM_MCMCsamples.RData` <br/>
 R object containing posterior samples from four chains of the run model (coda MCMC format)
 
  <br/>
  
 * `WildBoarIPM_Plots.R` <br/>
 Code for visualizing model results and generating the component plots for the figures included in the manuscript. 
 
 <br/>
 
 ## Data availability
 
 To run the model, a file containing processed individual-based data on wild boar demography is required (`WildBoarIPM_Data.RData`). <br/>
 At present, this data is not openly available.  <br/>
 
 To request access to the data, please contact Dr. Marl√®ne Gamelon: marlene.gamelon@univ-lyon1.fr
